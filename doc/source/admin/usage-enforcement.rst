Usage Enforcement
=================

Synopsis
========

Usage enforcement and lease constraints can be implemented by operators via
custom usage enforcement filters or an external service.

Description
===========

Usage enforcement filters are called on ``lease_create``, ``lease_update`` and
``on_end`` operations. The filters check whether or not lease values or
allocation criteria pass admin defined thresholds. There are currently two
filters provided out-of-the-box. ``MaxLeaseDurationFilter`` restricts the
duration of leases. ``ExternalServiceFilter`` calls a third-party service for
implementing policies using a URL configured in ``blazar.conf``.

Options
=======

All filters are a subclass of the BaseFilter class located in
``blazar/enforcement/filter/base_filter.py``. Custom filters must implement
methods for ``check_create``, ``check_update``, and ``on_end``. The
``MaxLeaseDurationFilter`` is a good example to follow. Filters are enabled in
``blazar.conf`` under the ``[enforcement]`` group. For example, enabling the
``MaxLeaseDurationFilter`` to limit lease durations to only one day would work
as follows:

.. sourcecode:: console

   [enforcement]
   enabled_filters = MaxLeaseDurationFilter
   max_lease_duration = 86400

..

Do note that filter config options follow filter names - the prefix is always
the snake case of the filter name (``MaxLeaseDurationFilter`` becomes
``max_lease_duration``; in this case it is special that there is nothing
beyond the prefix but there is also ``max_lease_duration_exempt_project_ids``).

MaxLeaseDurationFilter
----------------------

This filter simply examines the lease ``start_date`` and ``end_date``
attributes and rejects the lease if its duration exceeds a threshold. It
supports two configuration options:

* ``max_lease_duration``
* ``max_lease_duration_exempt_project_ids``

See the :doc:`../configuration/blazar-conf` page for a description of these
options.


ExternalServiceFilter
---------------------

This filter delegates the decision for each API to an external HTTP service.
The service must use token-based authentication, accepting (or ignoring)
the static token sent by Blazar in either the ``X-Auth-Token`` header, or
the ``Authorization: Bearer`` header, depending on your configuration.
The following endpoints should be implemented:

* ``POST /check-create``
* ``POST /check-update``
* ``POST /on-end``

The exact URLs can be overridden and not all have to be used (although
we imagine a proper implementation requires at least both checks unless
lease updates are disabled in the first place).

The external service should return ``204 No Content`` if the parameters meet
defined criteria and ``403 Forbidden`` if not. The service may send a JSON
body response with the ``403 Forbidden`` reply, including the rejection
reasoning in the field named ``message`` as in:

.. sourcecode:: json

   {
     "message": "You shall not pass!"
   }

An example of data the external service will receive in a request body (do note
all dates and times are encoded as strings following the ISO8601 standard that
is expected in JSON to represent dates and times):

* Request example:

             }

         }
       ]
     },

               "extra": {

               }
             },

               }
             }
           ]
         }
       ]
     }
   }

The ``current_lease`` field is present only in ``check-update`` requests and
describes the existing lease. In both checks the ``lease`` field describes
the new lease. In ``on-end``, the ``lease`` field describes the lease that
has just ended.

There is no guarantee on the delivery of the ``on-end`` event and it should be
considered an optimisation rather than a reliable mechanism.
